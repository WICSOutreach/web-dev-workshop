# Intro to Web Dev Workshop

## By WICS Outreach

Want to build a web application project but not sure where to start?
Learn the basics of building a basic end to end web application using HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and Python Flask! We will be creating a simple Expense Tracker website where a user can add items and view them by category.

# Setup

* Clone this repository. The main branch is a starter template we created with various TODO comments that we will be covering during the workshop.
* Install the following libraries in Python by using pip in the command line of the project's directory. If you do not have pip installed, please see the following link for more help (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/):
  * Navigate to the webjam-web-dev-workshop directory you just cloned, and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install all dependencies.
  * OR you can manually install each one"
    * Flask: ```pip install flask```
